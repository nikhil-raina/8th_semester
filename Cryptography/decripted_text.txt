the human nation of stormwind had fallen before the horde. knight champion anduin 
lothar gathered the scattered remnants of the human army and led the refugees 
north across the great sea to the kingdom of lordaeron. by enlisting the aid of 
other nations - humans, gnomes, elves, and dwarves - lothar helped form a great 
alliance to stand against the orcs and their ruthless new leader, orgrim 
doomhammer. the seemingly unstoppable horde continued its rampage, reinforcing 
its growing army with savage trolls and brutish ogres. but, on the eve of victory, 
gul'dan and his followers selfishly abandoned their allies to seek out powerful 
artifacts, forcing the weakened horde to retreat. doomhammer momentarily 
rallied the orcs when he slew lothar in a harrowing battle, but the hero's death did 
not break the alliance's resolve. turalyon, lothar's loyal lieutenant, quickly took up 
leadership of azeroth's defenders and finally defeated the horde.
