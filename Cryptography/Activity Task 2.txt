The author uses a constant analogy between the complications of cryptography to the real world. The casual interaction between the professor and the other students can be related to a novice student who is being introduced to the world of crypto.  There are several points in the lesson where basics such as “xoring”, long division, and logarithmic equations are explained conceptually rather than emitting bookish terminologies.  The comparison between DES and NIST was explained in general terms that can be grasped by the general audience. The three big ideas “Confusion”, “Diffusion”, and “Secret Only in the Key” were explained with the help of pictographs that helped in understanding the core concept of cryptography.
The most intriguing aspect of the lesson was the agreement between the professor and the student. I find this important not just in cryptography but in any industry where technology advances rapidly accompanied by new ideas and inventions.  The author introduces XOR as a tool to help in deciphering the code; not only did it make this process simple but, it reduced the percentage of math. With math, this process could have been a lot longer and complicated
In conclusion, the author does a commendable job of explaining complex concepts in a simpler environment. Students can easily pick up on concepts because the delivery is in a casual tone. This helps students with implementing these concepts in their workspace and assignments in an efficient way.
